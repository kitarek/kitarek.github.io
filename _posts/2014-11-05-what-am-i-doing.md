## Why ?

I always wanted to have some kind of home place in the Internet like in real
life but actually the idea of having blank page with my primary personal data
was awful. I'm not a big fun of social networks as I see how much valuable time
it takes to be up to date with all your (non-)friends and colleagues. I'm neither 
not a fun of sharing each stupid thing it comes to my mind.

## Awakening

Finally after a few months from writing a blog entry about 
[piece of my software](http://www.cognifide.com/blogs/cq/cq-unix-toolkit/) I
decided to share some of my daily journays/adventures related to my passion
which is `IT` or rather linux & programming (mainly Java, but I used to write
shell scripts a lot) as well as some soft (nicer) things like travels, events,
music (progressive rock rulez!). Moreover it's a great chance to sharpen my
English/markdown writing skills ;-).

## What to expect ?

I used to be typical _IT administrator_ over a few years so together with 
software-centric posts I will be tending towards devops/administration but
mostly I just would like to share some of my programming/linux experience
and fun with you.

I will tend to write posts in _soft_ manner without digging to much into the
details. In case of changing my mind watch out for tags like: **hardcore** or
something similar :-)

## Is there anybody out there ?

That's a good question. I'm not an artist so I'm not expecting any audience :-D
I treat that blog just like system log text file -- there are weird things
there sometimes but don't expect from nobody to read them all. Maybe some of 
my posts will be interested or not but is this so important right now ?

It's just my digital fingerprint so let fate guide it some way.
